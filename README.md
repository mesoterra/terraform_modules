# terraform_modules
This repository is intended to provide generalized modules that can be used for most projects or copied and customized for more specialized use.

Examples of plays that use the modules are located in `terraform_modules/examples`.

READMEs on each module are located within the module source directory, so for the `lb` module it would be `terraform_modules/aws/lb/`.
